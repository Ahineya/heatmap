D3.js heatmap calendar widget

Remarks:
I have used jpicker, not input[type=color], because I want my widget works on IE.
Widget contend does not updates via d3.js data but simply redraws. It doesn't took
much time and not even noticeable.

There are mocha+chai test that you can run via npm test.
If you have mocha-phantomjs installed globally.
He-he.

I really likes my top panel with that pretty buttons. So I haven't add more controls
to change widget's cell size etc.
